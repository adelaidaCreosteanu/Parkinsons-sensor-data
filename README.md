# Parkinsons-sensor-data
Identifying Parkinson's tremors from sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) from a wrist wearable.

I have developed this as part of a technical task for a position.

You can check out Solution.ipynb to see the notebook. To run it, you need scipy, pandas, and matplotlib. I would recommend using a virtual environment such as virtualenv or Anaconda.
